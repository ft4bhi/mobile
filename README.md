1. Bump the pubspec.yaml version number. This can be in a PR making a change or a separate PR. Use semantic versioning to determine which part to increment. The version number after the + should also be incremented. For example 0.3.3+000303 with a patch should become 0.3.4+000304.
2. Run workflow [Deploy to Play Store](https://github.com/lichess-org/mobile/actions/workflows/deploy_play_store.yml)
